# Final_Year_Project_Flood_Detection
Objective:
•	To detect flood occurrences using satellite images;
•	To compare and evaluate the performance of HRNet+OCR and Attention U-Net architectures for three-class flood detection, specifically distinguishing between background, permanent water, and flood water classes;
•	To generate a flood alarm system for disaster monitoring
